# Bi-directional-counter
Overview

A bi-directional counter is a digital counter capable of counting both upwards and downwards. It is commonly used in applications like digital clocks, frequency counters, and event counters. This repository contains the source code and implementation details for a bi-directional counter using an Arduino and a microcontroller-based system.

Features

Counts both up and down.

Uses two push buttons to control counting direction.

Displays count on an LED display or serial monitor.

Can be easily modified for different counting ranges.

Components Required

Arduino (Uno, Mega, or any compatible microcontroller)

Two push buttons

Resistors (10kÎ© for pull-down)

LED display or Serial Monitor

Jumper wires

Breadboard
